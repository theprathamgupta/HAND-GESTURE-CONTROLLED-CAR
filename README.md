# HAND-GESTURE-CONTROLLED-CAR
A project that demonstrates how to control a car using hand gestures with the help of Arduino and sensors. Instead of using a traditional remote, this system uses accelerometer/gesture detection to send commands wirelessly, making the car move forward, backward, left, right, or stop based on hand movements.
