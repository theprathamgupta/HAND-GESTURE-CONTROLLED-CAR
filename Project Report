ðŸ“‘ Hand Gesture-Controlled Car â€“ Project Report
1. Abstract

This project presents a gesture-controlled car that can be operated using hand movements instead of a conventional remote. An accelerometer sensor detects the tilt of the hand and transmits data wirelessly to an Arduino-based car, which then drives the motors accordingly. The system is cost-effective, beginner-friendly, and useful for robotics learning, automation, and assistive applications.

2. Objectives

To design and implement a car controlled via hand gestures.

To integrate Arduino, accelerometer, and motor driver for real-time control.

To demonstrate wireless communication (Bluetooth/RF) between transmitter and receiver modules.

To explore applications of gesture recognition in robotics and automation.

3. Components Used

(Include your BOM table here â€“ the one we created earlier.)

4. Methodology
4.1 System Design

Input Device: Accelerometer mounted on hand detects tilt/gesture.

Controller: Arduino processes sensor data.

Communication: Wireless transmission using HC-05/RF module.

Output: Motor driver IC controls DC motors to move the car.

4.2 Working Principle

The accelerometer captures hand movements (forward, backward, left, right, neutral).

Arduino at the transmitter side encodes these signals.

Data is sent wirelessly to the receiver Arduino.

Receiver Arduino decodes the data and drives motors via motor driver IC.

Car moves in the respective direction.

5. Results

The car successfully responded to gestures in real time.

Smooth movement achieved in five states: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop.

Wireless range tested up to ~10 meters (Bluetooth).

Average response time: <100 ms.

(Insert demo photos/screenshots here.)

6. Applications

Robotics competitions and DIY projects.

Assistive mobility devices for differently-abled people.

Smart automation and IoT experiments.

Educational tool for learning embedded systems.

7. Future Scope

Add obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor.

Use ESP32 / Wi-Fi module for IoT-based control.

Integrate with smartphone app for hybrid control.

Enhance gesture recognition using Machine Learning.

8. Conclusion

The Hand Gesture-Controlled Car successfully demonstrates how human gestures can be translated into robotic motion. It serves as a beginner-friendly embedded systems project and has potential applications in assistive technology and smart robotics.
